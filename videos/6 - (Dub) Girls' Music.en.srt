00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,535
[FEMALE VOICE]
Where am I?

2
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,506
Why am I not dead?

3
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,642
This isn't making any sense.

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,477
[MAN 6A]
Miss Mana Takamiya?

5
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,614
That's right,
and who are you?

6
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:54,187
The mysterious world of
aesthetics and perversion...

7
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,224
The forbidden door opens right
in front of Shido's very eyes.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,628
It will only scare you
for a little while.

9
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,857
It's an attack on
Shiori's awesomeness!

10
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,493
We're gonna do everything we can
to make sure you win this, girl!

11
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
Our band's lost some people.

12
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,396
Mainly because Ai is so selfish

13
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,731
and such a nightmare
to work with.

14
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,867
But, we're glad to have
the band back together!

15
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,569
That is so lame!

16
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,703
We have to beat them!

17
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm afraid losing
is not an option.

18
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,841
Wait a second‐‐
Origami, you're performing too?

19
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,878
I just need to know
who plays what!

20
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,380
I can play a
little guitar, I guess.

21
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,749
I can rock the bass.

22
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,318
I can play the drums!

23
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,488
The boom‐booms are
supposed to be mine!

24
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,356
[TOHKA sobbing]

25
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,758
Did she say
"boom‐booms?"

26
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,660
That is so lame.

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,763
Oh. That's right, you
wanted to play the drums, too.

28
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,733
I'm sorry, Tohka, but Mai is
pretty much an expert drummer.

29
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,336
We'll find something
for you to play. Cool?

30
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,373
Do you even know how
to play anything else?

31
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,442
[AI] I know!

32
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,478
Tohka, this is like way huge.

33
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,282
A legendary instrument
that's super hard to play.

34
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,251
The key to any band's success.

35
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,686
That is so lame!

36
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,994
Wow! It's incredible!

37
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,464
So, do you like it?

38
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,334
Just you watch!
I won't let you down!

39
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,401
[cheering]

40
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,004
Now all we need
is a lead singer.

41
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,573
Origami?

42
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,747
Wow, that was totally amazing!

43
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,949
I didn't know you could
sing like that, Origami.

44
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,717
That is so lame!

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,519
So you'll be singing!

46
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,688
It'll be my
"drop the mic" moment.

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,799
to bust my hump dealing with
that awful chick all day long.

48
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,901
I just can't keep it
to myself anymore.

49
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,605
What a relief no one's
around to hear me talking.

50
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,809
September twenty‐third, at
precisely fifteen hundred hours.

51
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,545
The 3rd battle squad will
charge into Tengu Square.

52
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:42,282
Our primary goal is to
capture Tohka Yatogami,

53
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,384
a girl thought to be a Spirit.

54
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,787
And secondly, we aim
to capture Shido Itsuka,

55
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,890
second year student
at Raizen High School.

56
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,658
Oh boy,
tomorrow's operation

57
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,627
is incredibly annoying.

58
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,428
I'm so exhausted
and unmotivated.

59
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,531
I'm worried I might forget
to lock the back door

60
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,800
to Hanger Number Two!

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,402
Did you catch that?
Hope so.

62
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,776
we will now commence
the twenty‐fifth annual

63
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,679
Joint‐High School
Cultural Extravaganza:

64
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,948
The famous and beloved
Tenou Festival!

65
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,551
[CROWD cheering]

66
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,988
[TOHKA laughing]

67
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,525
[TOHKA] It's so frilly!

68
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,892
[KAGUYA laughing]

69
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,028
I gotta hand it to you, Shido.

70
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,531
You look surprisingly good
in lady clothes!

71
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,333
Agreement. I would like
to take you home with me.

72
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,003
[SHIORI] Um...
So about this Maid Café...

73
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,038
This'll be fun.

74
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,406
We gotta take down
Rindoji, right?

75
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,009
With a beautiful but
surprisingly innocent girl,

76
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,611
a set of twins,

77
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,880
and a tall yet
timid and bashful type.

78
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,450
Come on!
The boys'll love us!

79
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,918
Except for the ones
who like older girls

80
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,486
or are into other dudes!

81
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,622
That is so lame!

82
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,023
[SHIORI] Wait...

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,560
Origami...
Does anyone know where she is?

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,962
Doubt. I have not
seen her at all.

85
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,732
Who knows, maybe she slept
straight through her alarm.

86
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,769
Anyway, "Poster Girl," you
better get your game face on.

87
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,705
We're counting on you
to bring in the customers!

88
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,407
[SHIORI] Whoa!

89
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,844
Cool! This is
gonna be so much fun!

90
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,381
We will follow your instructions
and commands, Shiori.

91
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,784
Because after all,
you're our Head Maid!

92
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,851
Huh?!

93
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,722
Your wish is our command!

94
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,123
Wait... What?

95
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,625
Well, I uh...

96
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,627
I guess my command
is that we all work hard!

97
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,028
‐‐[MAIDS] Yes, ma'am!
‐‐[TOHKA, KAGUYA] Yeah!

98
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,597
Step right up!

99
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,065
Don't be shy, boys!

100
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,808
[SHIDO] I'm so stressed
I'm seeing things.

101
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,545
[SHIORI] Miku...

102
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,114
Good morning, Shiori,
how are you today?

103
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,083
From the looks of things, I'd
say you're doing quite well.

104
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,619
How nice of you to say.

105
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,155
I've gotta admit...
Those clothes suit you.

106
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,757
In fact,
it might be interesting

107
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,692
for you to wear
that outfit everyday.

108
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,094
Who knows, over time
you might start to enjoy it.

109
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,597
And then you can be
my maid slave all the time.

110
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,666
What? No way. You...

111
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,669
Wow, can't take a joke, huh?

112
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,004
Why don't you all
go somewhere else?

113
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,979
[SHIDO] Of course.
That's Miku's power.

114
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,781
[MIKU] This is better,
wouldn't you agree?

115
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,215
For someone
who's scoping the enemy,

116
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,617
you're not very discreet.

117
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,953
[MIKU] Oh, I'm not
doing that at all.

118
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,187
If you wanna know the truth,

119
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,857
I came here to
ask you out on a date.

120
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,192
A date?

121
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,964
Here! Enjoy!

122
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,766
[SHIORI] Oh. Thanks.

123
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,702
Mmm!

124
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,004
Goodness, this is really tasty!

125
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,175
[KOTORI] She asked her out
after just one day?

126
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,910
I can't tell if she's
really into Shiori

127
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,879
or just that
full of herself.

128
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,482
Regardless, her happiness level
going up doesn't hurt us.

129
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,250
Just do me a favor and
don't say anything like

130
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,652
"I hate you" this time!

131
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,253
Yeah, yeah, I know.

132
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,224
It's good.

133
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,259
Oh, I'm glad you like it!

134
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,566
[MIKU] Here...

135
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,502
This way we'll be even.

136
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,270
[KOTORI]
Why are you hesitating?

137
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,172
Go ahead! Take a bite!

138
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,177
[giggling]

139
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,914
You know,
that's almost like we kissed!

140
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,621
Shiori, look! Over here!

141
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,757
It's a ring toss!
These are so much fun!

142
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,258
So which prize do you want?

143
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,628
You just name it
and I'll get it for you.

144
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,297
[SHIORI] The cat, I guess.

145
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,833
Okay.

146
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,035
Watch, I'll get it
on the first try!

147
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,237
[MIKU] Ha! Ha!

148
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,005
Take that!

149
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,075
Oh man. That's way
harder than I thought.

150
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,043
[SHIORI laughing]

151
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,578
[KOTORI]
What are you, a clown?

152
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,312
Stop laughing and
win the prize, dummy.

153
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,916
Hey, Miku.
Why don't you let me try?

154
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,820
You are going to give me
that plushy cat at once.

155
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,255
Of course!

156
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,190
Here. It's all yours.

157
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,128
[MIKU] Here you are, Shiori!

158
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,830
Why did you do that, Miku?

159
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,065
‐‐It's wrong.
‐‐[KOTORI] Shido!

160
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh. Is this not
the one you wanted?

161
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,670
‐‐[SHIORI] That's not it!
‐‐exchange it for you.

162
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,771
What's wrong with you?

163
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,105
That's not how things work.

164
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,674
[MIKU] Oh. Well...

165
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,642
In that case,
what am I supposed to do?

166
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,745
you win the game
fair and square. 'Kay?

167
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,148
But what happens if I lose
and still want the prize?

168
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,017
[SHIORI] You give up
or keep trying!

169
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,919
Just think about the
people who work here!

170
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,253
Don't you think it
would make them sad

171
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,089
to know they've
been manipulated?

172
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,323
[MIKU] Sad?

173
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,159
that I would even accept
